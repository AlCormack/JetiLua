            <h1>RPM Headspeed</h1>
            <p>Some ESC's don't output head speed and only output motor RPM. This app lets you enter the motor pole pairs (pole pairs. ie a 10 pole motor has 5 pole pairs) and gear ratio. The main gear has a decimal input to allow calculation for two-stage drive like the Gaui R5. The application will also optionally speak out the head speed continually when a user- defined switch is active. The app logs the Headspeed in the jeti logs using the latest tx firmware. This enables review of the head speed in the Data Analyser application.<br>
